        <h1>Our Principles</h1>
        <h2>This is how we aspire to build our new business sustainably while staying true to our values.</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>We believe in a simple and honest approach to business:</strong>
                <p>We believe that today's business model of extreme consumerism is broken. We want to be a positive force for change and impact the world in a meaningful way. We want to create a sustainable business that supports a network of other small Ethiopian makers and ethical brands.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>We want to do our part to reduce the huge levels of unnecessary plastics and chemicals in our environment:</strong>
                <p>We want to inspire people to live a simple and more considered life, choosing functional products that are made to last, are beautifully designed, ethically sourced, contain no nasties and as much as possible are plastic free, reusable or recyclable. We firmly believe that choosing products like these will enhance our customers lives while being kind to our environment. After all, there is no planet B.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>We aim to sell products made from natural ingredients from brands we believe in:</strong>
                <p>That means no parabens, phthalates, SLS/SLES and unnecessary synthetic fragrances or preservatives. If a product must contain palm oil then we insist that it’s sustainably certified. We prefer organic only ingredients but we don’t insist on this as organic doesn't always mean sustainable - we look at our suppliers’ overall ethos. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>We give back to our community:</strong>
                <p>We plant a tree with every order. We donate 1% of our gross sales to 1% for the Planet and we volunteer in our local community.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
