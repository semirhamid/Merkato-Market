        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Items return depends on seller. For further Info please contact the seller</strong></p>
        <p>Most sellers gives you a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days after receiving your item to request a return.

To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unused, and in its original packaging. You’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.</p>

<div>
    <h4>Damages and issues</h4>
    <p>Please inspect your order upon receipt and contact us immediately if the item is defective, damaged or if you receive the wrong item, so that we can evaluate the issue and make it right. If your order arrives damaged in transit please take us some photos of the condition of the order.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>Exceptions / non-returnable items</h4>
    <p>Certain types of items cannot be returned, like perishable goods and sanitary wear. Please get in touch if you have questions or concerns about your specific item. 
Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns on sale items or gift cards.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h4>Exchanges</h4>
    <p>The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for the new item.</p>
</div>


<div>
    <h4>Refunds</h4>
    <p>We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and let you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be automatically refunded on your original payment method. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund too.</p>
